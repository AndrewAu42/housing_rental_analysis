# housing_rental_analysis
This is an analytical review of the San Francisco Area housing market. The idea is to review the information for housing cost per square foot versus the rent cost over a span of time, specifically for this review we're taking a look at 2010 - 2016. The idea is to look through the data and present it through the MAPBOX API, and make it presentable for review of the changes that occured during the presented time period.
